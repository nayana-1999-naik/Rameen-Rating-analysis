# Rameen-Rating-analysis
"Analyzing Ramen Ratings: Insights from The Ramen Rater Dataset" This project examines thousands of ramen reviews to identify the best brands, top countries for ramen, and the impact of packaging style (Cup, Bowl, Pack) on ratings.
Title:
"Analyzing Ramen Ratings: Insights from The Ramen Rater Dataset"

Problem Statement:
People love ramen, but not all brands and flavors are the same. Some receive high ratings, while others do not. This project analyzes thousands of ramen reviews to determine the best brands, the top countries for ramen, and whether packaging style (Cup, Bowl, Pack) affects ratings. The goal is to understand what makes a great ramen!

Conclusion:
OLS Model Performance:

Based on RÂ² = 70% and Adjusted RÂ² = 69%
RÂ² = 70% means that 70% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by independent variables, indicating a good fit.
Adjusted RÂ² = 69%, slightly lower than RÂ², suggests that some independent variables might not be significantly contributing to the model.
Impact of Adjusted RÂ²:

Adjusted RÂ² accounts for the number of predictors, meaning adding more variables did not greatly improve model performance.
